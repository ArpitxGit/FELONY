# Unlimited void
An On-Chain sharable and verifiable content management platform, gamified using generative AI.

>Unlimited Void brings the user and their targets inside the Limitless itself, which is an endless void resembling outer space in appearance, with a large black hole, distant galaxies and numerous white patches in the background. Boundless raw information floods into the target's mind, overwhelming them to the point where they're completely immobilized.
>The complete incapacitation of the target is caused by a phenomenon where the target will be able to see and feel everything while not being able to see or feel anything at the same time. All the actions one has taken in their life is forced upon them infinitely and they can't do anything but die slowly. This effect does not affect the user or anyone they're touching, whether willingly or not, which can be exploited by an opponent to become immune to the domain expansion's effects.
